## Installation

To install use pip:

```xsh
xpip install xontrib-pygitstatus
# or: xpip install -U git+https://github.com//xontrib-pygitstatus
```

## Usage

This xontrib will get loaded automatically for interactive sessions.
To stop this, set

```xsh
$XONTRIBS_AUTOLOAD_DISABLED = ["pygitstatus", ]
# if you have set this for other xontribs, you should append the vale
```

## Differences from gitstatus

PyGitStatus is a fork of [gitstatus](https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/blob/0.12.5/xonsh/prompt/gitstatus.py) that nearly follows the same logic as the original gitstatus prompt, but with a few differences:

-   Conflict files are intentionally excluded from pygitstatus.staged.
-   The pygitstatus prompt will include conflicted files when both are added to the index and the working tree.

## Xontrib Promotion (DO and REMOVE THIS SECTION)

-   Check that your repository name starts from `xontrib-` prefix. It helps Github search find it.

-   Add `xonsh`, `xontrib` and other thematic topics to the repository "About" setting.

-   Add preview image in "Settings" - "Options" - "Social preview". It allows to show preview image in Github Topics and social networks e.g. Twitter.

-   Enable "Sponsorship" in "Settings" - "Features" - Check "Sponsorships".

-   Add xontrib to the [awesome-xontribs](https://github.com/xonsh/awesome-xontribs).

-   Publish your xontrib to PyPi via Github Actions and users can install your xontrib via `xpip install xontrib-myxontrib`. Easiest way to achieve it is to use Github Actions. Register to https://pypi.org/ and [create API token](https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken). Go to repository "Settings" - "Secrets" and your PyPI API token as `PYPI_API_TOKEN` as a "Repository Secret". Now when you create new Release the Github Actions will publish the xontrib to PyPi automatically. Release status will be in Actions sction. See also `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
